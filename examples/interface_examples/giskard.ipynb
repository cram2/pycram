    "# Giskard interface in PyCRAM\n",
    "This notebook should provide you with an example on how to use the Giskard interface. This includes how to use the interface, how it actually works and how to extend it. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start by installing and launching Giskard. For the installation please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/SemRoCo/giskardpy).\n",
    "After you finish the installation you should be able to launch Giskard by calling: \n",
    "```\n",
    "roslaunch giskardpy giskardpy_pr2_standalone.launch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This way you can launch Giskard for any robot that is supported:\n",
    "```\n",
    "roslaunch giskardpy giskardpy_hsr_standalone.launch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Standalone\" means that Giskard only uses a simulated robot and does not look for a real robot. If you want to use Giskard with a real robot you have to switch out \"standalone\" with \"iai\", e.g:\n",
    "```\n",
    "roslaunch giskardpy giskardpy_hsr_iai.launch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what Giskard is doing you can start RViz, there should already be a MarkerArray when starting otherwise you have to add this manually."

    "## How the Giskard interface works \n",
    "The PyCRAM interface to Giskard mostly relies on the Python interface that Giskard already provides ([tutorial](https://github.com/SemRoCo/giskardpy/wiki/Python-Interface) and the [source code](https://github.com/SemRoCo/giskardpy/blob/master/src/giskardpy/python_interface.py)). This interface provides methods to achieve motion goals and load things into the Giskard believe state. \n",
    "\n",
    "What PyCRAM does with this, is: Synchronize the belief state of Giskard with the one of PyCRAM by loading the environment URDF in Giskard, this is done before any motion goal is sent. Furthermore, the motion goals are wrapped in methods that use PyCRAM data types. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also set collisions between different groups of links. By default, Giskard avoids all collisions but for things like grasping an object you want to allow collisions of the gripper. The interface also supports the following collision modes:\n",
    "    * avoid_all_collisions\n",
    "    * allow_self_collision\n",
    "    * allow_gripper_collision\n",
    "The collision mode can be set by calling the respective method, after calling the method the collision mode is valid for the next motion goal. Afterwards, it defaults back to avoid_all_collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a ```init_giskard_interface``` method which can be used as a decorator. This decorator should be used on all methods that access the giskard_wrapper, since it assures that the interface is working and checks if Giskard died or the imports for the giskard_msgs failed. "

    "## Extend the Giskard interface\n",
    "At the moment the PyCRAM Giskard interface is mostly a wrapper around the Python interface provided by Giskard. If you want to extend the interface there are two ways:\n",
    "   * Wrap more motion goals which are provided by the Python interface \n",
    "   * Design new Higher-Level motion goals by combining the motion goals already provided"
