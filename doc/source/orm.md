# ORM

The ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) module provides a way to interact with databases using Python objects. 
It allows you to define your database schema as Python classes and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
operations using Python methods.
The ORM module abstracts away the complexities of SQL queries and database connections, allowing you to work with
Python objects instead of raw SQL statements.
You can store and retrieve your pycram plans, allowing you to save and load robot experiences and improve your 
robot's performance over time.

It is built on top of SQLAlchemy, a powerful SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for Python.
